# Arduino RGB state machine

An arduino sketch that acts as a state machine to switch between two modes. RGB and Rainbow mode.
Note that the code is written for an arduino shield made by me as student. The blueprint for the PCB is:

RGB mode:
Shines constantly. Use the potentiometer to switch between the colour you wish the RGB diode to shine.

Rainbow mode:
This mode loops through all different colour combination sequencially. Use the potentiometer to adjust the speed of the rainbow effect.
